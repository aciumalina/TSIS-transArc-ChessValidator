The ChessPositionValidator system is responsible for validating chess positions expressed using Forsyth–Edwards Notation (FEN).
The Main component acts as the entry point of the system and delegates the validation of a FEN string to a dedicated validator component.
The Default Fen Validator component provides the main validation service and coordinates the execution of multiple validation rules.
This component requires one or more validation rule services and invokes them to assess different aspects of a chess position.
Each validation rule is represented by a separate component exposing a validation interface.
The Structure Validator checks whether the FEN string follows the correct structural format.
The Piece Count Validator verifies constraints related to the number and types of chess pieces.
The King Placement Validator ensures that the placement of kings follows the rules of chess.
All validation rule components evaluate the same FEN input independently and return a boolean result.
The overall validation result is determined by the Fen Validator component based on the outcomes of the individual rule checks.
